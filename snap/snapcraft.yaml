description: |
  λtext is a generic templating tool for any text file. For languages that
  don't support import-style code-reuse, it's common to just copy/paste.
  However, after a change is needed, that change must be replicated manually
  to every file needing it. With λtext, you parameterize the files themselves,
  and let λtext do the pasting.
